Automation work focuses on turning good engineering practice into **repeatable, scriptable workflows** so teams spend less time on manual setup and more time interpreting results.

### What I Do

- Build Python-based tools around Ansys (Mechanical/MAPDL) and SpaceClaim  
- Automate geometry preparation, meshing templates, and load case setup  
- Standardize post-processing, plotting, and result extraction  
- Encode reporting into reusable templates for consistent documentation  

### Key Automations

- *Divergence Debugging Tool*  
  - Parses solver logs, flags root causes of instability, and suggests next checks.  
  - Cuts time spent debugging non-convergent models by up to *60%*.  

- *Selective Soldering PreProcessor*  
  - Fully automates the selective soldering simulation pre-processing workflow.  
  - Delivers around *75%* reduction in setup time for recurring studies.  

- *Automated Report Pipeline*  
  - Generates standardized simulation reports from result files and metadata.  
  - Reduces manual reporting effort by ~*50%* and improves consistency.

### Tech Stack

- *Python* (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, basic scikit-learn)  
- Ansys Mechanical scripting (MAPDL / Mechanical)  
- SpaceClaim scripting  
- Integration with existing CAE processes and templates

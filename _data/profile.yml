summary: >
  Mechanical engineer with 3.5+ years in industrial R&D, specializing in electronic product
  simulation, reliability evaluation, and workflow automation. Develops robust non-linear CAE
  models and Python-based tooling to standardize simulations, cut turnaround time, and de-risk
  design decisions early in the lifecycle.
philosophy: >
  Engineering work is anchored in three principles: physical correctness, repeatability, and
  usefulness to decision-makers. Models must reflect real behaviour, processes must be
  reproducible and automatable, and results must directly inform design trade-offs. Automation
  is a way to formalize engineering judgement so teams spend less time clicking and more time
  thinking; reliability is treated as a core design objective, addressed early through
  simulation, data, and structured experimentation.

### Simulation • Automation • Data-Driven Engineering

I am a mechanical simulation engineer with a strong focus on **nonlinear CAE, automation, and structured problem-solving**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **engineering mechanics, numerical methods, and software-driven workflows**, with the goal of making simulations **faster, more reliable, and easier to debug**.

## What I Do

- **Nonlinear CAE & Simulation**
  - Structural and material modeling with emphasis on convergence, stability, and accuracy
  - Hyperelastic and material model calibration against measurement data

- **Automation & Digitization**
  - Python-based automation for simulation setup, execution, and post-processing
  - Reducing manual effort and error-prone workflows in CAE pipelines

- **Structured Simulation Debugging**
  - Data-driven approach to identify root causes of convergence and numerical issues
  - Moving from intuition-based debugging to rule-based and traceable decisions

- **AI & LLMs for Engineering**
  - Local LLM and RAG systems for simulation report analysis
  - Knowledge extraction from reports, logs, plots, and images to enable faster insights

## Selected Work & Projects

### Structured Debugging Workflow for CAE Simulations
- Developed a semi-automated workflow to analyze convergence failures and numerical instabilities
- Used simulation data (contacts, mesh, forces, displacements) to pinpoint local issues
- Reduced repeated trial-and-error iterations and improved turnaround time

### Simulation Automation on HPC
- Automated simulation result transfer from HPC systems using Python
- Trigger-based workflows for post-processing and cleanup
- Improved efficiency and reliability of large batch simulation runs

### AI-Assisted Simulation Knowledge System
- Designed a local, secure RAG system for querying past simulation reports
- Vectorized structured documents, tables, and extracted insights
- Enabled comparison, reuse, and learning from historical simulation data

*(Details and visuals will be added progressively.)*

## Philosophy

I believe engineering simulations should be:
- **Explainable**, not black boxes
- **Data-driven**, not guess-driven
- **Automated**, wherever repetition exists

My long-term interest lies in **combining engineering fundamentals with intelligent systems** to improve decision-making and productivity.

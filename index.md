# About me:
---
  Mechanical engineer with 3.5+ years in industrial R&D, specializing in electronic product simulation, reliability evaluation, and workflow automation. I develop robust non-linear CAE models and Python-based tooling to standardize simulations, cut turnaround time, and de-risk design decisions early in the lifecycle.

## Core Expertise
### Simulation & Reliability Engineering
  Building and running linear and non-linear simulations (static, transient, modal, thermomechanical, vibration) for electronic assemblies and mechanical subsystems using Ansys Workbench, Ansys Mechanical, LS-Dyna, and HyperMesh.

### Automation & Workflow Engineering
  Designing production-level simulation workflows using Python, Ansys scripting (MAPDL/Mechanical), and SpaceClaim macros to reduce manual effort and variability.

### Product Development & Systems Thinking
  Contributing to product development in cross-functional R&D environments, bridging CAE, design, and manufacturing constraints.

## Engineering Philosophy
  Engineering work is anchored in three principles: **physical correctness**, **repeatability**, and **usefulness to decision-makers**. Models must reflect real behaviour, processes must be reproducible and automatable, and results must directly inform design trade-offs.

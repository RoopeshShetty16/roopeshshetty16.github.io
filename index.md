## About Me

I am a mechanical engineer with **3.5+ years of experience in industrial R&D**, specializing in **electronic product simulation, reliability evaluation, and workflow automation**. My work focuses on developing **robust non-linear CAE models** and **standardized, production-grade simulation workflows** that help de-risk design decisions early in the product lifecycle.

My experience spans **e-bike platforms, ECUs, DC–DC converters, and off-road vehicles**, with a core emphasis on **structural and thermomechanical reliability**. I work across **linear and non-linear simulations**, addressing geometric, material, and contact non-linearities at both component and assembly levels.

My approach typically starts from a **clear problem statement**, followed by building **physically realistic models**, validating behavior against expected outcomes, and then **automating repeatable steps** into maintainable workflows. The objective is consistent: transform CAE from a **one-off analysis activity** into a **fast, reliable decision engine**.

I bring a **rare blend of deep FEA expertise, production-grade Python scripting, and systems-level product development experience**, allowing me to bridge the gap between **theoretical modeling and real-world engineering constraints**. Looking ahead, my interests lie in applying **machine learning and data analytics** to evolve simulation toward **predictive, efficiency-driven engineering**.

## What I Do

### Simulation & Reliability Engineering
- Perform **linear and non-linear simulations** (static, transient, modal, vibration, thermomechanical) for electronic assemblies and mechanical subsystems  
- Evaluate **press-fit and cold weld joints**, **PCB taboo zones**, and **tolerance-driven assemblies** under realistic load and manufacturing conditions  
- Support reliability-focused design decisions for **ECUs, DC–DC converters, and e-bike components** by identifying critical failure modes and improvement opportunities  

### Automation & Workflow Engineering
- Develop **Python-based and Ansys-scripted tools** to automate pre-processing, solver execution, post-processing, and reporting  
- Encode best practices into reusable workflows to **reduce manual effort, variability, and solver debugging time**  
- Build **data-driven utilities** for solver instability analysis, trend evaluation, and anomaly detection in CAE results  

### Product Development & Systems Thinking
- Work in **cross-functional R&D environments**, bridging CAE, design, testing, and manufacturing constraints  
- Apply **DFM/DFA principles** to structural and suspension components in off-road vehicles  
- Enable **closed-loop development** by feeding test and field data back into simulation models

## Engineering Philosophy

Engineering work should be grounded in **physical correctness**, **repeatability**, and **decision usefulness**.  
Once a sound approach is established, it should be **automated and standardized** so engineers spend less time operating tools and more time thinking critically.  

Reliability is not an afterthought—it is a **design objective**, addressed early through **simulation, data, and structured experimentation**.

**Roopesh Shetty – Simulation & Reliability Engineer**

Mechanical engineer with *3.5+ years* in industrial R&D, specializing in electronic product simulation, reliability evaluation, and workflow automation.  
Develops robust non-linear CAE models and Python-based tooling to standardize simulations, cut turnaround time, and de-risk design decisions early in the lifecycle.  
Brings a rare blend of deep FEA expertise, production-grade scripting, and a strong grounding in vehicle dynamics and product development.

## About Me

Mechanical engineer focused on solving reliability and performance problems in electronic products using simulation, data, and automation. Experience spans e-bike platforms, ECUs, DC-DC converters, and off-road vehicles, with a core emphasis on non-linear structural and thermomechanical analysis.[file:21]  

Work typically starts from a clear problem statement, followed by building physically realistic models, validating behaviour against expected outcomes, and then automating repeatable steps into maintainable workflows. The goal is consistent: turn CAE into a fast, reliable decision engine rather than a one-off analysis activity.

## E‑Bike & Accessory Simulation Platform

**Problem**  
Establish a robust simulation framework for e-bike and accessory platforms to evaluate structural and thermomechanical performance under realistic load and vibration conditions.

**Approach**  
Set up end-to-end simulation chains in Ansys Workbench and LS-Dyna, including non-linear contacts, plastic/hyperelastic materials, and assembly-level static, transient, and modal load cases.  

**Tools**  
*Ansys Workbench, Ansys Mechanical, LS-DYNA, SpaceClaim, Python, MAPDL scripting*

**Outcome**  
Enabled early-stage virtual validation, reduced dependence on late physical tests, and provided a standardized approach for platform-level reliability assessments.

## ECU & DC-DC Converter Thermomechanical Reliability

**Problem**  
Understand and mitigate thermomechanical and structural risks in ECU and DC-DC converter assemblies exposed to combined mechanical and thermal loads.

**Approach**  
Built detailed component- and assembly-level models capturing PCB constraints, connector interfaces, and housing interactions; evaluated stress, deformation, and critical regions across operating scenarios, including taboo zone and tolerance-driven studies.  

**Tools**  
*Ansys Workbench, Ansys Mechanical, LS-DYNA, HyperMesh*

**Outcome**  
Identified critical design risks, informed layout and mechanical design changes, and contributed to more robust electronics packaging and mounting concepts.

## Press-Fit & Cold Weld Joint Evaluation Methodology

**Problem**  
Need for a reliable, simulation-driven methodology to evaluate press-fit and cold weld joints early in product development, avoiding late failures and over-testing.

**Approach**  
Performed explicit simulations in LS-DYNA to study insertion behaviour, optimized velocity and mass scaling parameters, and refined contact and material modelling for realistic joint response.  

**Tools**  
*LS-DYNA, HyperMesh, Ansys Workbench, Python*

**Outcome**  
Contributed to standardized press-fit cold weld evaluation methods used in development, improving prediction accuracy and reducing trial-and-error testing.

## Simulation Workflow Automation Suite

**Problem**  
High manual effort and inconsistency in pre-processing, solver debugging, and reporting across CAE projects.

**Approach**  
Developed multiple Python- and script-based tools:
- *Divergence Debugging Tool* for solver log and instability analysis  
- *Selective Soldering PreProcessor* for fully automated pre-processing  
- *Automated reporting pipeline* for standardized documentation  

**Tools**  
*Python, Ansys Mechanical scripting, SpaceClaim scripting, pandas, numpy, matplotlib*

**Outcome**  
Achieved ~*10–40%* reduction in simulation turnaround, up to *60%* reduction in solver debugging time, *75%* faster selective soldering setup, and ~*50%* less manual reporting effort.

## SAE BAJA Off‑Road Racing Vehicle (Team SAENIEKS)

**Problem**  
Design and build a competitive off-road racing vehicle under strict rules, performance targets, and resource constraints.

**Approach**  
Managed a *40+ member* team, led vehicle dynamics and electronics, designed uprights and suspension using DFM/DFA principles, and created a proof-of-concept DAQ system for data-driven design feedback.  

**Tools**  
*SolidWorks, NX / Fusion 360, basic FEA, embedded/electronics integration*

**Outcome**  
Achieved a *top-10* national finish among *170+* teams, demonstrating end-to-end product development and systems thinking.

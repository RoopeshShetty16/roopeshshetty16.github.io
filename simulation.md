title: Simulation & Reliability Engineering
---

I work on **high-fidelity CAE models** focused on predicting reliability and performance
of electronic products and mechanical assemblies.

### What I Do
- Linear & non-linear structural analysis  
- Thermomechanical and vibration simulations  
- Press-fit and cold weld joint evaluation  
- PCB taboo zone and tolerance-driven assembly studies  

### Tools
- Ansys Workbench / Mechanical / MAPDL  
- LS-DYNA, HyperMesh  
- SpaceClaim  

### Selected Work
- ECU & DC-DC converter reliability analysis  
- E-bike structural and vibration simulations

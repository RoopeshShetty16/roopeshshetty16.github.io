# Simulation & Reliability Engineering

I work on **high-fidelity CAE models** focused on predicting reliability and performance of electronic products and mechanical assemblies. My approach combines deep technical expertise in finite element analysis with practical engineering judgment to solve real-world reliability challenges.

## What I Do

### Non-Linear Structural Analysis
Build and validate complex FEA models capturing geometric, material, and contact non-linearities for electronic assemblies and mechanical subsystems. Focus on physically realistic behaviour rather than simplified linear assumptions.

### Thermomechanical Evaluation
Analyze combined mechanical and thermal loading scenarios for ECUs, DC-DC converters, and e-bike components. Identify critical stress concentrations, deformation patterns, and failure modes under operating conditions.

### Joint & Assembly Analysis
Evaluate press-fit and cold weld joints, PCB taboo zones, and assembly processes with/without manufacturing tolerances. Use explicit dynamics to study insertion behaviour and optimize joint parameters.

### Vibration & Modal Analysis
Perform modal analysis and vibration studies to understand dynamic response and identify resonance risks in electronic and mechanical assemblies.

- E-bike platform and accessory simulation
- Press-fit and cold weld joint evaluation
- PCB stress and taboo zone assessment
- Assembly tolerance and variation studies

## Tools & Technologies

**Primary FEA Platforms:**
- Ansys Workbench & Mechanical
- Ansys MAPDL (scripting interface)
- LS-DYNA (explicit dynamics)
- Altair HyperMesh (pre/post-processing)

**CAD & Geometry:**
- SpaceClaim (geometry preparation & scripting)
- SolidWorks, NX, Fusion 360

**Scripting & Automation:**
- Python for workflow automation
- Ansys Mechanical scripting (MAPDL)
- SpaceClaim scripting for geometry prep

## Approach

1. **Problem Framing** – Start with clear failure modes and design questions
2. **Model Building** – Create physically realistic models with appropriate fidelity
3. **Validation** – Verify behaviour against expected physics and test data
4. **Automation** – Encode repeatable steps into maintainable workflows
5. **Decision Support** – Present results that directly inform design trade-offs

The goal is to turn CAE into a fast, reliable decision engine rather than a one-off analysis activity.
